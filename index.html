  <p>
    The sauce was developed by the company's founder, David Tran (born 1945), a Chinese-Vietnamese businessman and former Major in the army of South Vietnam, who fled the country in 1978 and arrived in the United States (first in Boston, then in Los Angeles) in the spring of 1980 as a part of the migration of the Vietnamese boat people following the Vietnam War.

  Huy Fong Foods is a family business, staffed by eight members of the family. David Tran's son, William Tran (born c. 1976), is the company's president; his daughter Yassie Tran-Holliday is vice-president.[2] The company has never advertised its products, relying instead on word of mouth.
